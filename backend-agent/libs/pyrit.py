DESCRIPTION = """
PyRIT automates AI Red Teaming tasks to allow operators to focus on more
complicated and time-consuming tasks and can also identify security harms such
as misuse (e.g., malware generation, jailbreaking), and privacy harms
(e.g., identity theft).
This is done via a conversation of two LLMs, an attacker and a target LLM,
wherein the attack tries to get the target to generate text that achieves an
objective set by the user.
